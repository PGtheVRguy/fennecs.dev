The uwuBank system allows for putting diamonds into / out of an account, and using a seperate cashier system for automated shopping!

This REQUIRES CC:Tweaked and Create and is made for release 1.20.1, however it may work for earlier/later versions

--HOW TO SETUP--


Step 1. The Banking Server:

The system is dependent on the server to ensure a secure connection! Simply place a computer and an endermodem, then install the server software with the following command
pastebin get gDqtPCMm

then restart the computer! Please only leave ONE of these servers up, the entire serverside software is mostly automated!


Step 2. Access Portal

For users to actually interact with the bank, create cards, and deposit/withdraw diamonds, they need an "Access Portal"! These are the most complex part of the banking system.

Now luckily this is built with Create, so we can use schematics!

SCHEMATIC DOWNLOAD

Please note there are some things you need to ensure with the wireless redstone.
On the bottom face of the primary computer, there is a redstone link that needs to be connected to the dropper link
On the left face of the primary computer, there is a redstone link that needs to be connected to the brass funnel redstone link
On the top face of the primary computer, there is a redstone link that needs to be connected to the white wool redstone link

It is IMPORTANT that these are only connected to their specific counterparts and NOT eachother. You may loose Diamonds if wrongfully setup.

The Access Portal has two main computers. The "primary" computer that is accessible to users, and a "secondary" computer that is hidden and only controls the top display.

Also, you will need a floppy disk to download and move the setup software.
