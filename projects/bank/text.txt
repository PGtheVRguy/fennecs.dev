The "uwuBank" system is a banking system for Create/ComputerCraft, without any commands or cheats.

The uwuBank system allows for putting diamonds into / out of an account, and using a seperate cashier system for automated shopping!

This REQUIRES CC:Tweaked and Create and is made for release 1.20.1, however it may work for earlier/later versions

--HOW TO SETUP--


<li>BANKING SERVER</li>

The system is dependent on the server to ensure a secure connection! Simply place a computer and an endermodem, then install the server software with the following command
<code>pastebin get gDqtPCMm</code>

then restart the computer! Please only leave ONE of these servers up, the entire serverside software is mostly automated!


<li>ACCESS PORTALS</li>

For users to actually interact with the bank, create cards, and deposit/withdraw diamonds, they need an "Access Portal"! These are the most complex part of the banking system.

Now luckily this is built with Create, so we can use schematics!

Please note there are some things you need to ensure with the wireless redstone.
On the bottom face of the primary computer, there is a redstone link that needs to be connected to the dropper link
On the left face of the primary computer, there is a redstone link that needs to be connected to the brass funnel redstone link
On the top face of the primary computer, there is a redstone link that needs to be connected to the white wool redstone link

It is IMPORTANT that these are only connected to their specific counterparts and NOT eachother. You may loose Diamonds if wrongfully setup.

The Access Portal has two main computers. The "primary" computer that is accessible to users, and a "secondary" computer that is hidden and only controls the top display.

Also, you will need a floppy disk to download and move the setup software. 


Ensure you have a floppy disk plugged in, and install the tar.lua from this repo
<a href="https://github.com/MCJack123/CC-Archive/tree/master">CC Compression GitHub</a>
As of writing, there is no pastebin link so you will have to copy and paste the tar.lua code into a file dubbed 'tar.lua'

This is genuinely a really good tool when it comes to ComputerCraft programming!

Now you can install the actually software with these two lines of commands. 
<code>pastebin get Fbn0xNSY
tar -xf file.tar</code>
they should all go onto your floppy disk!

Afterwards, run the "bankInstaller.lua", once done eject the floppy disk and restart the computer.

Restart the machine, and hold "CTRL+T" to terminate the program. Create a file called "id", and give it a number ID that is unique to the machine. Access Portals and Cashiers both run on the same ID system so ENSURE this is UNIQUE from EVERYTHING!!

Move up to the display computer, place a disk drive next to it, and put the floppy disk in!
Run "displayInstaller.lua"

Now you're done!



<li>CASHIER</li>

NOTICE!! There is a MAJOR vulnerability within this release of the Cashier. Currently, both the ID we are paying to and the money required to spend is in two seperate VERY OPEN files. I greatly apologize and plan to fix this in the future!

To install the Cashier program, simply place down the schematic, and install this program

<a href = "cashier.nbt" download>Download Create Schematic </a>

<code>pastebin get CnRXAVqB</code>

Afterwards, setup a file called "sender", you give this the floppydisk ID (you can see it flash up on the Access Portal when a floppy disk is first inserted) of whoever is recieving the money.
Then, you make a file called "paying", here you put ONLY the price (in Diamonds) of the item!
Finally, you make a file called "id", just like the Access Portal, you want to ensure this ID is unique from all other Cashiers AND Access Portals.

All values in those files NEED to be numbers.

Now you are done! If you have any issues feel free to modify anything you'd need! I believe there are ways to prevent manual terminations from programs for the cashier, but I rather find a proper fix later!

Thanks for checking it out!


Heres the mods/texturepacks used:

<a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked">ComputerCraft</a> 
<a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/create">Create</a> 

I'll likely update this installation "Guide" on if there are changes with 1.21 (and when I fix the security vulnerability in the cashier)!
