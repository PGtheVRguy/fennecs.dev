The Fennec-1 is a Raspberry Pi 3 handheld device programmed entirely in Python. This project is inspired of Sci-Fi handhelds like Fallouts "Pip-Boy" and creator Zach Freedmans "Singularitron".

The entire device is designed around one central hub program/menu that allows one to easily program more apps for the device with the menu dynamically adding them onto the user interface. This project was a great learning experience as it allowed me to get a better grasp at how to have multiple Python projects interact with eachother, adding IO to the Raspberry Pi, and have a fully physical and practical project complete. All the things I've learned with this project are as followed.

- Better utilization of larger Python projects
- How to design a circuit board
- Using OnShape to design a case
- Wiring and interfacing with IO on the GPIO ports of the Pi

Now the project as of 5/29/24 is not complete, currently Opal (one of my friends) and I just cut out the circuit board on copper, and soon I will solder the buttons and cables to it off a breadboard. The next challenges is finding a portable battery small enough to fit in the device.

I believed I was nearly done with the project. I replaced the RPI3 with an RPI0W which is much smaller but easy to integrate my code over. Then, I reprinted my case to hold some Cherry MX Blue keyboard keys, soldered them together and... the cables I use dont like sticking to the keyboard keys

Additionally, the switch from the Pi 3 to Pi Zero didnt fix the cable issue (wow who'd guess that)! And then to stack ontop of the disasters, school ended! I'm dual enrolled into the OSTC-NW campus, and so I can utilize many of the tools apart of the mechatronics class, which is how I'm able to solder and manufactur my circuit boards for this. 

So, here's my new plan. Later this week I plan to head to Microcenter, buy a soldering iron, Pi Zero 2 (boot times are really bad on the Zero 1), and one of those handy prototype circuit board things, as most of the space issues come from my poor cable management.

After that, I can finally tackle the main issue, powering the damn thing on the go! (and strapping it to my arm)



In the meantime I'll be reworking this website so I can actually turn this large post into several blogs! Look 'ma, I can blog now!
