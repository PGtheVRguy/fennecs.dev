The Fennec-1 is a Raspberry Pi 3 handheld device programmed entirely in Python. This project is inspired of Sci-Fi handhelds like Fallouts "Pip-Boy" and creator Zach Freedmans "Singularitron".

The entire device is designed around one central hub program/menu that allows one to easily program more apps for the device with the menu dynamically adding them onto the user interface. This project was a great learning experience as it allowed me to get a better grasp at how to have multiple Python projects interact with eachother, adding IO to the Raspberry Pi, and have a fully physical and practical project complete. All the things I've learned with this project are as followed.

- Better utilization of larger Python projects
- How to design a circuit board
- Using OnShape to design a case
- Wiring and interfacing with IO on the GPIO ports of the Pi

Now the project as of 5/29/24 is not complete, currently Opal (one of my friends) and I just cut out the circuit board on copper, and soon I will solder the buttons and cables to it off a breadboard. The next challenges is finding a portable battery small enough to fit in the device.
