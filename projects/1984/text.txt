This game was created as part of a school assignment in my LA10 Honors class. This was based off a book I read around the time dubbed "1984" by George Orwells. This game is fairly simple where you just need to solve simple questions related to the game and showcase how you belong to the community (as in the book, those who go or showcase any form of hate to the major Government gets killed). However, a large portion of your score then comes from how much you rebell. The concepts in this game could be interesting, but the time crunch and lack of passion caused the game to be rather short and boring.
