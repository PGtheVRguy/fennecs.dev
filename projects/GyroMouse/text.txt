The following cautionary tale I am about to tell you is not one of successes, but of utter failures. One of a project that took two months to build, two redesigns, and an angery thrust of the object into my locker for light to never touch upon the tomb of parts again.

This projects tale starts in late September. I was looking for a cool project idea that I thought could be practical, but interesting. 

My idea was simple, what if I designed a glove with a gyroscope on it so that I can move my mouse with the flick of my hand, akin to a VR Controller/wiimote! This idea struck me one night while I was in bed watching YouTube, but not wanting to get up and click for the next video.

I ordered a gyroscope and within a week built my first working prototype. This is when disaster struck. As you can (currently) see with the Fennec-1, most of my projects fail to exit prototyping. However, this one I had a plan. Within the next two weeks I designed a small box

Now, one of the biggest challenges of mine is shoving a large package in a small space. Im running a standard Pico W and for some reason really wanted to use normal breadboard cables, and we had very few small ones at OSTC(the engineering school I attend). Eventually, I realize that the glove idea is both too expensive (anything beyond what I already immediately have is out of budget for me), and dumb. And so, I chose to redesign the project.

One of the greatest controllers of all time is not the Dualshock controller, not the SNES controller, nay do I even say the VirtualBoy controller. I see it as the wonderous WiiMote. 

And so, I spent a day and designed the coolest wiimote EVER. Designed with 3 LED indicators, a massive center button, and two buttons on the bottom. (The big button is left click, one button toggles between moving the mouse and scrolling, the last button is right click)

However, I then found it that the design was too small, then found out that I wanted an additional button to turn off moving all together, then found out I wanted to be able move with a joystick too. Eventually
