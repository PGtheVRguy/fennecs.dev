This is the source code for my personal website, "fennecs.dev"!

Everything is written in natural HTML, CSS, and JS.

This website is my first website, so everything is pretty mismatched, alongside having side projects integrated into it because I dont want to host several websites.



Everything runs under a purple look for it all, purple is the best color.
There are three main fonts. Freeman-regular, a font with "IBM" in the title but I forgor the rest of the name, and another font I randomly named "code.ttf" that looks like that same IBM font but bold.



The goals for the website are as followed

-Make a proper "default page" that everything links to so that I dont have to copy and paste my page template
-Make the blogs better
