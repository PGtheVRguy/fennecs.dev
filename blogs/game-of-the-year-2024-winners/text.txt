	Oh shoot. I forgor about this. Ummmm uhhh crap. 


	Awhile ago I "promised" to run some Game Awards but uhh whoops completely went over my head! Turns out the GOTY awards this year were actually pretty good! I agreed with a lot of the awards, Balatro did amazingly, and yeah, 'twas good! <br>
	However, I did still write down my awards and winners lol. 


	Notice, most of the categories are jokes. My only rule was that I had to have played it *that year*, not first time, just play it. (Except for Game Of The Year where I totally lied, I first played it this year but still wrote it down)<br><br>

	I might try to actually do one this year but expect everything to be Red Dead 2 since thats what I've prominently played so far this year. Sorry!!

	drumroll please...
