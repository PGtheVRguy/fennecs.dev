    I've always been a fan of <a href="https://thegameawards.com/">The Game Of The Year Awards</a> hosted by gaming Jesus, Geoff Keighly. However, throughout the years things have always felt off to me. Each year, some bogus entries get into the game awards, and everything every award feeling more like a paid advertisement and not an actual award. Alongside that, with the disastorous modern push towards live-service gaming and remakes, GOTY has changed too. Some of the major titles in the Game Awards this year are remakes, DLCs, and games that have already released. The "Players Choice" awards are in fact, a (very good) DLC, two new live-service games, Genshin Impact, and Black Myth Wukong. That's right, only 3/5 of those are actual 2024 games. And amongst all the other categories it feels like only 10 games are being mentioned. And seriously, Resident Evil 2 remake is a remake, most of the work is done for the team, it doesnt deserve an actual change at goty.
<br><br>
    Sure, I understand most of us (including me) come to these things just for the announcements. E3 is dead, in person events still exist but arent as prevelent. Everyone has their own Nintendo Direct. But I just want a fun, fair, gaming award. Have a game to root for when it wins, and a collectively hated game to hate on when we believe it buys its way in. So that's why today, I am announcing the Fennecs Award! 
<br><br>
    So, what am *I* gonna do about it. Sure, I can sit here and design a blog section of my website just to complain about the biased and paid for Game Awards. But no, I dont just complain (I stopped when I quit Twitter). Here, we build. That's right... today... we announce... the... FENNECS GAME AWARDS 2024. The first annual luxorious gaming award show designed around the concept of the rules being made up when I choose the awards and everything being so biased they literally cannot be paid for. 
<br><br>
    Now what makes me creditable? Simple, I'm not! I've only purchased six games on Steam this year, and a few things through Gamepass! You can trust that my game awards is entirely unique to those fake awards. So instead of continuing to introude this, lets lay out the rules.
<br>
<br>
<br>
-I have to have played the games after November 2023 (Lethal Company Clause)
<br>-Each game must fit its category

<br><br>
    To clarify the first rule: The game / DLC / update / battlepass / season / live-service buzzword / metaverse room / Roblox Experience / RecRoom room/ VRchat Level / Fortnite Store Item / Game Modes / UGC does NOT have to have released this year, JUST that I have played it*

The winners of the Fennecs Award will be announced somewhere on my <a href="https://youtube.com/PGtheVRguy">YouTube channel</a> (maybe live, idk). Each winner will have a trophy that I may potentially ship out if I feel like it. This is what our team is currently drafting!
<br><br><br><img src="trophy.png" alt="A really shitty remake of the GOTY awards trophy, in Blender"></img><br>
As you can see, the trophy is a wholey original idea that took several hours to design. We ran a thorough design process of initially getting an idea, getting inspiration and references, testing in 2D, designing plastic and clay prototypes, designing in Blender, realizing that OnShape would be better, re-realizing that Blender would be better, then moddeling this in 5 minutes. <br> The figure is supposed to represent a bat creature because I was trying to make angel wings but I failed and they looked like bat wings. The upward trajectory of the character is supposed to represent a rise of the game in the slop of modern gaming, the eyes are supposed to represent all the eyes looking at the game thanks to the game winning. The circular base is a circular base.

<br><br>
This idea is purely one of INTENSE SERIOUSNESS and NO HUMOR. And so, ONLY TRUE HONOR AND RESPECT will be taken of figuring out thy victors! If you would like to see more, subscribe to my <a href="https://youtube.com/PGtheVRguy">YouTube channel</a>, fennecsdev. I will be working on a live stream or premier of what I choose for EVERY AWARD. If you plan on potentially swaying my vote, email me at noah@fennecs.dev. Thank you so much for visiting this website and page and have an amazing rest of 2024.
